**Wine Quality Analysis Using the KDD Process**:
This project involves the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process to analyze and predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. We utilize the expanded Wine Quality dataset with 1697 samples.

**Overview**
This project employs the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process to delve into the relationships between various physicochemical properties of wines and their perceived quality. Using the expanded Wine Quality dataset comprising 1697 samples, we aim to understand the key factors that influence wine quality.

**1**. **Introduction**
The Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process is a structured approach to data analysis, encompassing several key phases, from data selection to evaluation. This project showcases these phases using the Wine Quality dataset.

**2.** **Dataset** **Description**
The dataset captures various properties of wines, such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol percentage, and more. The primary objective is to predict the wine's quality, which is scored between 0 and 10.

**3.** **KDD Process Steps**

  3.1 Data Selection:
We begin by loading the expanded Wine Quality dataset.

  3.2 Data Preprocessing:
This step involves checking the dataset for missing values and addressing them if any are detected.

  3.3 Data Transformation:
To ensure the data is ready for modeling, we standardize the features, bringing them to a common scale.

  3.4 Data Mining:
Here, we split the dataset into training and testing subsets. A linear regression model is trained on the training data to predict wine quality.

  3.5 Evaluation and Interpretation:
The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, we interpret the model by examining the coefficients of the linear regression, providing insights into the influence of each feature on wine quality.

**4. Insights and Conclusions**:
The model's coefficients offer valuable insights. Features with positive coefficients enhance wine quality when they increase, while those with negative coefficients detract from wine quality as they rise.

**5. Instructions for Execution**:
Ensure you have the necessary libraries (like pandas and scikit-learn) installed. Run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook to execute the KDD process and observe the results.
